This is a thread pooling class that allows you to create an instance of Pool and set it's maximum number of threads.
You can then queue up threads to your hearts delight and let it do the work for you.

To stop all the threads you can either call .KillAll() or .Dispose()
The intent behind .Dispose() is that you are done and will not be using it anymore.
The intent behind .KillAll() is that you DO want to re-use the pool and you can call .Restart() to get it running again.

To queue up a task you can use .Enqueue(yourThreadStart)
  or you can call .Enqueue(yourParameterizedThreadStart, yourObjectForTheThread)

The default number of threads is 10 and the max allowed is 1024.  If you try to set 0 or less the default of 10 will be
used.  If you try to specify more than 1024, the max of 1024 will be used.
